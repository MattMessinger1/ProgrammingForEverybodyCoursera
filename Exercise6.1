#Exercise 6.1 Write a while loop that starts at the last character in the string and 
#works its way backwards to the first character in the string, printing each letter 
#on a separate line, except backwards.



word = raw_input('Enter a word: ')
index = -1
while index >= -len(word):
    letter = word[index]
    print letter
    index = index - 1
