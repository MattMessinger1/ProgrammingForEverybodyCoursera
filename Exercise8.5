#Exercise 8.5 Write a program to read through the mail box data and when you find line 
#that starts with “From”, you will split the line into words using the split function. 
#We are interested in who sent the message, which is the second word on the From line.
#From stephen.marquard@uct.ac.za Sat Jan 5 09:14:16 2008
#You will parse the From line and print out the second word for each From line, then you 
#will also count the number of From (not From:) lines and print out a count at the end.
